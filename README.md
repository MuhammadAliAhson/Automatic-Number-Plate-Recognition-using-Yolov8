# Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) with YOLOv8

## Overview
This project implements an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system using the YOLOv8 model. It is designed to detect and recognize vehicle number plates from images.

## Features
- Number plate detection using YOLOv8.
- Robust recognition system capable of handling different lighting conditions and angles.

## Installation
To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Install the required dependencies:

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook `ANPR_with_Yolov8.ipynb` to see the project in action.

## Note on AI Detection
The ANPR system is designed to detect vehicle number plates. It should not be used for detecting or recognizing human faces or any other sensitive information that could lead to privacy violations or ethical concerns.
